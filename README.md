UART Transmitter and Receiver (Verilog)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) in SystemVerilog, including both Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) modules, along with a baud rate generator.

UART is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables full-duplex data transfer with configurable baud rates.
This project is designed and tested on EDA Playground.

ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… UART Transmitter (TX) â€“ serializes 8-bit parallel data and sends it bit by bit.

âœ… UART Receiver (RX) â€“ receives serialized data and reconstructs 8-bit parallel data.

âœ… Baud Rate Generator â€“ generates ticks for precise baud timing (configurable).

âœ… Loopback Test â€“ TX output directly connected to RX input to validate end-to-end data transfer.
